              The La Sagrada Familia Parish in Barangay Sulipa, Gerona, Tarlac, is a notable landmark in the region. 
              Designed by the late Rev. Fr. Alex Bautista (1969–2020), the church was constructed in 2017. 
              Fr. Bautista, who also designed the Saint Josemaria Escriva Parish—the first church in Asia dedicated to the saint—described La Sagrada Familia Parish as a testament to how "faith, culture, and environment contribute to the design of a church replete with heritage values."

              <br> <br>
              
              Beyond its architectural significance, La Sagrada Familia Parish serves as a vibrant spiritual and community center. 
              It hosts regular masses, religious celebrations, and cultural events, drawing both parishioners and visitors from across Tarlac and beyond. 
              The church has become a pilgrimage site, admired for its beauty and the spiritual devotion it inspires.

              <br> <br>

              With its deep connection to faith, history, and local identity, La Sagrada Familia Parish stands as a lasting tribute to Fr. Bautista's legacy—an enduring symbol of devotion and artistic excellence in the heart of Barangay Sulipa.

              The St. Michael the Archangel Parish Church in Camiling, Tarlac, has a rich history dating back to the 18th century. Established in 1874, it stands as one of the oldest religious structures in the province. The original church, built during the Spanish colonial period, showcased Baroque architectural features. Unfortunately, in 1997, a devastating fire gutted its interior, leaving only the facade and buttresses intact. Over the years, these remnants have been encroached upon by business establishments, with some parts repurposed inappropriately. Heritage advocates and local residents have been campaigning for the church's restoration since March 2018. 
              <br><br>
              The parish celebrates its annual fiesta in honor of St. Michael the Archangel, reflecting the deep-rooted faith and traditions of the Camiling community.

          <p>St. John Nepomucene Parish Church, located in Anao, Tarlac, has a rich history intertwined with the town's development. Anao was established as a municipality on March 16, 1870, after separating from Paniqui, which was then part of Pangasinan province. The town's early settlers were primarily Ilocano-speaking immigrants from Paoay, Ilocos Norte, who initially named their settlement "Balete" due to the abundance of balete trees in the area. This name later evolved to "Anao," derived from the Ilocano word "Danao," meaning creek. 
            
            <br><br>
            The parish church, dedicated to St. John Nepomucene, was established in 1935. It is situated in the town center near the municipal hall and is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarlac. 
            The church serves as a central place of worship and community gathering for the predominantly Ilocano-speaking population of Anao.

              The first church was built in 1740, and a new stone-and-wood structure was completed in 1890. Unfortunately, it was destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. 
              On July 15, 2022, a historical marker was installed, recognizing its significance. Today, it serves as the seat of the Diocese of Tarlac and remains a major place of worship in the city.

            Santo Niño Parish Church, located in Barangay Santo Niño, Bamban, Tarlac, was canonically established in 1812 by Augustinian missionaries who arrived in the area in the early 1700s. 
            The current church structure was founded in 1936. During World War II, the church suffered significant damage but was subsequently restored. 
            Notably, the front arch featuring the image of Santo Niño is the only original structure that remains intact.

            <br> <br>
            
            In 1991, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo led to lahar flooding in Bamban and surrounding towns, causing residents to evacuate to higher grounds, such as the Dapdap Resettlement area. 
            Fortunately, the church, situated on elevated terrain, was not affected by the lahar flow. 
            Today, Santo Niño Parish Church continues to serve as a vibrant center for worship and community activities in Bamban.

          Santa Faustina of the Divine Mercy Parish, located in Barangay Canan, Paniqui, Tarlac, holds the distinction of being the first and only parish in the Philippines and Asia dedicated to Saint Faustina Kowalska. 
          Established on February 24, 2003, the parish was solemnly dedicated on May 27, 2012.
          <br><br>
          The church is renowned for its stunning white façade and houses a relic of Saint Faustina, the Polish nun who initiated the Divine Mercy devotion. 
          Pilgrims from various regions visit the parish, seeking spiritual solace and divine intervention, especially in matters of health, inspired by Saint Faustina's own battle with tuberculosis during her early years as a nun.
          Today, Santa Faustina of the Divine Mercy Parish continues to serve as a vibrant center for worship and community activities, embodying the message of Divine Mercy that Saint Faustina propagated.

          The Shrine of St. Therese of the Child Jesus in Ramos, Tarlac, was originally a small chapel built in 1944 during World War II. Initially, Mass was held only once a month by Dominican priests. 
          In 1952, it became an independent parish, and in 1995, a new church structure was built with the support of the community and benefactors, including former President Corazon Aquino.
          <br> <br>
          It was officially elevated to a shrine in 2004 by the Diocese of Tarlac. 
          Today, it is a major pilgrimage site and is known as the "Wedding Capital of Tarlac" due to its beautiful architecture and serene atmosphere.
